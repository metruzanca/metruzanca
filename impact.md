Looking back at the places I've worked. Some, I can remember clearly what I've done and what kind of an impact I've had but for some, I can't. There's this one position at XYZ where I really enjoyed both the people and the code. I even managed to survive a layoff. Must have meant that I've done enough that leadership thought I was worth keeping. But looking back, I'm not sure I would have kept myself. I can't really point to anything worth while that I've done. Heck, I mostly remember the time I wasted on fruitless "side-quests".

I've had more impact at companies after that one, but none of them were as much of a good fit. I think the issue was that I felt "too comfortable" at XYZ, likely because I was given things like: trust, ownership and agency. And instead of acting on it, I just became lazy.

Today, working at [Chainalysis](https://Chainalysis.com) I caught myself in a pattern that felt similar to when I was at XYZ. I'm being given the same three things again: trust, ownership and agency but instead of using those things to prosper, I'm just becoming complacent. I've even let myself miss a deadline for a feature release (_to which get got complaints from customers_).
