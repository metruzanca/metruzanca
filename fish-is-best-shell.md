Pros: UX, auto completes, good defaults, abbr instead of alias (shell history), configuration, rust, default keybinds with alt+up/down to cycle args & alt+left/right to cycle cd history, no plugins necessary as its a fully featured shell, configuration via conf.d and functions folder makes so much sense and is easier to setup your shell in an organized fashion, `fish_config` command to easily customize your theme (if not doing that via alacritty).

Cons: non-posix (but doesn't actually matter!)
