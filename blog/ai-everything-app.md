With the rate of progress we have with AI, there's no doubt that software will be democratized. Anyone will be able to create new software, to their specific needs and their personal preferences. If you don't like any of the available options, you'll just make your own.

Other topics to think about
- If software is cheap, then data is going to be more important. Especially if that data can be shared across apps.
- Interconnecting apps, will probably still be a challenge. Just like with humans, the AIs or the developers of the AIs will still have to come up with a protocol for interconnecting apps. Initially it'll all be bespoke integrations, but we'll soon settle on a protocol.
- AI optimized frameworks, tools, languages. Why are AIs writing React and Nodejs servers? Because thats what they were trained on, but once AI can radically start improving its own code, we can go back to plain js and maybe rust servers. Using whatever is literally most performant even if it would be inconvenient for a human to write and deal with.



some discord  thoughts



So the current mode for software is a team makes a server and client.
Some teams just manage datasets e.g. The Movie Database project
I think those are going to start becoming more popular
As well as servers that allow users to make their own clients. Or servers allow interconnecting of apps and/or social media-like features
Because while anyone can make their own software, a product like discord will still be hard to replace, due to the: 1. infrastructure requirements (cost+expertise), 2. the social aspect. If you make your own app, you need to get all your friends to use it, but they will try to have their own as well.
So for these typesof problems, we'll still need novel innovations. And sure, wait long enough and once theres a "solution" that works, we'll have to find yet another completely novel problem
And theres no guarentee that there will be such a problem
Agents that write flawless code and AGI are still different things. We might get flawless coders but we'll still have problems to solve.

And we'll solve them by thinking and delegating flawless coders.

> Anything that can be made will be made in an instant by anyone.  There will be no more barriers to entry for anything.  The market will be absolutely overwhelmed by a tsunami of slop where you won't be able to find what you want because there will be 500 alternatives of everything.  And all of the world's most meaningful works of art will be forever diluted by this sea of slop.  Genuine human purpose like a drop of blood in an ocean.

Well like you said before, it'll be democratized. So you won't be looking for things, you'll just be making your own. There won't be 500 alternatives, because nobody will post them anymore.
