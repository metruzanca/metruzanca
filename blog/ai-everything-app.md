With the rate of progress we have with AI, there's no doubt that software will be democratized. Anyone will be able to create new software, to their specific needs and their personal preferences. If you don't like any of the available options, you'll just make your own.







<!--
Other topics to think about
- If software is cheap, then data is going to be more important. Especially if that data can be shared across apps.
- Interconnecting apps, will probably still be a challenge. Just like with humans, the AIs or the developers of the AIs will still have to come up with a protocol for interconnecting apps. Initially it'll all be bespoke integrations, but we'll soon settle on a protocol.
- AI optimized frameworks, tools, languages. Why are AIs writing React and Nodejs servers? Because thats what they were trained on, but once AI can radically start improving its own code, we can go back to plain js and maybe rust servers. Using whatever is literally most performant even if it would be inconvenient for a human to write and deal with.
