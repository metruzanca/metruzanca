## Role attributes

Here's a reference table for common roles. Sorted by a guess of how common they are.

| Role Name            | Description                                                                                                                              | Usage Notes (ai generated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `role="img"`         | Indicates an element is an image.                                                                                                        | Generally used when an `<img>` tag isn't feasible, such as background images with semantic meaning. Ensure an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` provides equivalent alternative text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `role="button"`      | Identifies an element as a clickable button.                                                                                             | Often used when creating custom button-like controls from non-button elements (e.g., `<div>`). Requires keyboard event handling (Space/Enter) and focus management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `role="navigation"`  | Identifies a collection of navigational links.                                                                                           | Use for primary navigation menus or significant sets of links. Aids screen reader users in quickly finding navigation sections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `role="link"`        | Designates an interactive element as a hyperlink.                                                                                        | Primarily used when an `<a>` tag with an `href` isn't suitable, but the element functions as a link (e.g., a custom routing solution). Requires keyboard event handling and focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `role="dialog"`      | Designates an overlay window that requires user interaction before proceeding.                                                           | Used for modal dialogs (pop-ups). Requires careful focus management (trap focus within the dialog), keyboard handling (Esc to close), and `aria-modal="true"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `role="alert"`       | Communicates an important, time-sensitive message to the user.                                                                           | For dynamic content updates that require immediate attention but aren't interruptive (e.g., "Item added to cart"). Use `aria-live="assertive"` for critical, high-priority messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `role="search"`      | Identifies a section of the page containing search functionality.                                                                        | Helpful for screen reader users to quickly locate search forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `role="list"`        | Groups a collection of static, related items.                                                                                            | Similar to `<ul>` or `<ol>`. Items within a `list` typically use `role="listitem"`. **`list` is for presentational or informational lists.** Users can generally navigate the entire list. Example: a list of blog posts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `role="listbox"`     | Identifies a widget that presents a list of options from which the user can select one or more.                                          | **`listbox` is for interactive selection widgets.** Items within a `listbox` use `role="option"`. It supports single (`aria-multiselectable="false"`) or multiple selection (`aria-multiselectable="true"`). Users typically navigate options using arrow keys and select with Space/Enter. Example: a dropdown select menu. This is a common pattern for custom select elements.                                                           |
| `role="toolbar"`     | A collection of commonly used functions or controls presented in a compact visual area.                                                  | Think of an editor's toolbar (bold, italic, underline). Contains interactive elements like buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `role="grid"`        | Identifies a composite widget that contains a collection of items, each with several editable properties, organized in rows and columns. | For tabular data that is interactive or editable, beyond just presentation (`<table>`). Requires nested `role="row"` and `role="gridcell"`. Complex, use only when native `<table>` or CSS Grid isn't sufficient for the desired interactive behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `role="tablist"`     | A container for a set of tab elements.                                                                                                   | Used for tabbed interfaces. Requires nested `role="tab"` for each tab and `role="tabpanel"` for the associated content. Keyboard navigation (arrow keys to switch tabs) and focus management are crucial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `role="status"`      | A live region where new content is added and old content may be removed.                                                                 | For non-critical updates that are important but don't require immediate user action (e.g., "Loading complete"). Similar to `aria-live="polite"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `role="form"`        | Identifies a region that contains an interactive form.                                                                                   | Primarily for grouping related form controls. Can be useful if a form is not wrapped in a `<form>` element. Screen readers can often jump to forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `role="application"` | Indicates that the element and its children represent a web application, rather than a traditional web document.                         | **Use with extreme caution.** This role tells assistive technologies to pass all keyboard events directly to the application, bypassing the browser's default handling. Only use if you are completely re-implementing standard browser behaviors (e.g., focus management, keyboard shortcuts) for all descendant elements. Most common web pages are documents, not applications in this sense. Misuse can severely degrade accessibility. |
